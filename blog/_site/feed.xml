<p>War is all about money and the notion of ‚ÄòWe Are Right‚Äô.  But to what debt will we continue to make with such ignorance and applied trauma onto those around us and in the world we live? We continue to write checks our asses can‚Äôt cash and it manfests itself far into generations to come long after the war is over. The space here on Earth is growing smaller and smaller by the day which means the actions we all take effect us all in one way or another.  Especially wars and the actions of moraly bankrupt officials who push war as the best business model plan known to man. Surly by now we should have come up with other clever ways to jump start economies, growth, and so forth. But alas we are still stuck on stupid. You are either in the circle or out of the circle. This is life‚Ä¶</p>

<p>So why even write about it? Well this is just a wau for me to practive my skills with the written word.  Period‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Today i would like to indroduce you to a female blogger who went by the name, Riverbend.<br />
Riverbend is a pseudonymous author of the blog <em>( <a href="https://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/">Baghdad Burning</a>)</em> 
 launched on August 17, 2003.  From the weblog we know she is a young 
Iraqi women from a mixed Shia and Sunni family living with her parents and brother in Bagdad.  Her exhistence and identity remain a mystery.</p>

<p>Riverbend was a female computer programmer in her home city of Baghdad, Iraq.  She goes onto explain her experience as the gears of war violated, destroyed, and seperated the people within her city of Baghdad, Iraq. 
Obviously the sanctity of private residences were being violated along with people being unlawfully arrested, but what always struck a cord with me was how the puppets of war divided the local religions and seperating the people accordignly to their specific religion.</p>

<p>If you would like to learn more about RIverbend and her story you can check out her blog here: <em>( <a href="https://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/">Baghdad Burning</a>)</em></p>

<p>Do you know EGP? As a welder for the last 20 years we didn‚Äôt really write much in our daily life. so this blog here is a personal project to get my the skills with the written word back up and running‚Ä¶ We have a lot to say‚Ä¶ Enjoy</p>

<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/17/natiCU9I8oPlAFD.png" alt="jesus-gang.png" /></p>

<p>‚ÄòTHE Devil is our CURE‚Äô<br />
There is a sailing man who lives out West. He is a philosopher, writer, researcher, scientist, system‚Äôs engineer, master woods craftsman and teacher, created the Ephemeral Group Process. His name is Forrest Laundry and he has some curious ideas we should all consider. One such idea is The EGP or Ephemeral Group Process mentioned earlier.  The EGP asks important questions like ‚ÄúWhat are the skills and processes that enable powerful and transformative conversations in our society? Or What are the skills and processes that enable powerful and transformative conversations? Communication and mediation between any and all persons on Earth no matter race, creed, or nation of origin. 
They say the Devil is in the details. Within the details lies linguistic thought forms that act a cure. So the Devil is the cure? Maybe‚Ä¶  A killer in you is the killer in me. Within the details of our collective narrative as well as written history resides memetic phrases that behave much like living organisms. These memetics make up what we call the memeplex. Viruses transmit via horizontal transmission as does the language of memetics travels via horizontal transmission. The Devil is the cure that lies within these details. Viruses that which are memetic truths like the meme WWJD hold value in curing societies confusion of double bind tactics and other less honorable low sorcery of the written word, tickling the lily waves right into your prefrontal cortex. 
A 4 letter word #WWJD, What would Jesus do? Rings true still and is one such Devil that is in the details.  A wonderful oxymoron blend of opposite irony showing itself every so lightly like a thundering silence.  This is our model of the type of memetic virus that is the CURE.  All in all if you‚Äôre in a certain situation or observing another person that you may or may not understand fully for a number of reasons we won‚Äôt mention here, we encourage you to remember the memetic KEY of WWDJ, for it‚Äôs help and truth will guide you with understanding and compassion that you may be the best version of yourself to yourself as well as to others.  What would Jesus do? He would e,body Grace.  <a href="[NASA](https://www.youtube.com/@tomsachsmovies)">Grace</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cure lies within the details.

<p>You‚Äôll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home">Jekyll docs</a> for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll‚Äôs GitHub repo</a>.
