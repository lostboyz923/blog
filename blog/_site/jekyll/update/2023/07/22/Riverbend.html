<p>War is all about money and the notion of ‚ÄòWe Are Right‚Äô.  But to what debt will we continue to make with such ignorance and applied trauma onto those around us and in the world we live? We continue to write checks our asses can‚Äôt cash and it manfests itself far into generations to come long after the war is over. The space here on Earth is growing smaller and smaller by the day which means the actions we all take effect us all in one way or another.  Especially wars and the actions of moraly bankrupt officials who push war as the best business model plan known to man. Surly by now we should have come up with other clever ways to jump start economies, growth, and so forth. But alas we are still stuck on stupid. You are either in the circle or out of the circle. This is life‚Ä¶</p>

<p>So why even write about it? Well this is just a wau for me to practive my skills with the written word.  Period‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Today i would like to indroduce you to a female blogger who went by the name, Riverbend.<br />
Riverbend is a pseudonymous author of the blog <em>( <a href="https://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/">Baghdad Burning</a>)</em> 
 launched on August 17, 2003.  From the weblog we know she is a young 
Iraqi women from a mixed Shia and Sunni family living with her parents and brother in Bagdad.  Her exhistence and identity remain a mystery.</p>

<p>Riverbend was a female computer programmer in her home city of Baghdad, Iraq.  She goes onto explain her experience as the gears of war violated, destroyed, and seperated the people within her city of Baghdad, Iraq. 
Obviously the sanctity of private residences were being violated along with people being unlawfully arrested, but what always struck a cord with me was how the puppets of war divided the local religions and seperating the people accordignly to their specific religion.</p>

<p>If you would like to learn more about RIverbend and her story you can check out her blog here: <em>( <a href="https://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/">Baghdad Burning</a>)</em></p>
