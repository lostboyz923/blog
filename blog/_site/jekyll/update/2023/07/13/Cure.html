<p>Do you know EGP? As a welder for the last 20 years we didn‚Äôt really write much in our daily life. so this blog here is a personal project to get my the skills with the written word back up and running‚Ä¶ We have a lot to say‚Ä¶ Enjoy</p>

<p>‚ÄòTHE Devil is our CURE‚Äô<br />
There is a sailing man who lives out West. He is a philosopher, writer, researcher, scientist, system‚Äôs engineer, master woods craftsman and teacher, created the Ephemeral Group Process. His name is Forrest Laundry and he has some curious ideas we should all consider. One such idea is The EGP or Ephemeral Group Process mentioned earlier.  The EGP asks important questions like ‚ÄúWhat are the skills and processes that enable powerful and transformative conversations in our society? Or What are the skills and processes that enable powerful and transformative conversations? Communication and mediation between any and all persons on Earth no matter race, creed, or nation of origin. 
They say the Devil is in the details. Within the details lies linguistic thought forms that act a cure. So the Devil is the cure? Maybe‚Ä¶  A killer in you is the killer in me. Within the details of our collective narrative as well as written history resides memetic phrases that behave much like living organisms. These memetics make up what we call the memeplex. Viruses transmit via horizontal transmission as does the language of memetics travels via horizontal transmission. The Devil is the cure that lies within these details. Viruses that which are memetic truths like the meme WWJD hold value in curing societies confusion of double bind tactics and other less honorable low sorcery of the written word, tickling the lily waves right into your prefrontal cortex. 
A 4 letter word #WWJD, What would Jesus do? Rings true still and is one such Devil that is in the details.  A wonderful oxymoron blend of opposite irony showing itself every so lightly like a thundering silence.  This is our model of the type of memetic virus that is the CURE.  All in all if you‚Äôre in a certain situation or observing another person that you may or may not understand fully for a number of reasons we won‚Äôt mention here, we encourage you to remember the memetic KEY of WWDJ, for it‚Äôs help and truth will guide you with understanding and compassion that you may be the best version of yourself to yourself as well as to others.  What would Jesus do? He would e,body Grace.  <a href="[NASA](https://www.youtube.com/@tomsachsmovies)">Grace</a></p>
