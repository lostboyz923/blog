Captains Log: 14 
    It's 4:12 in the morning. The events from the previous day are a blur and all i remember was there was a loud bang and then i blacked out.  I found myself laying in my own bed suffering from this pain radiating from my ankles.  My bike is leaned against the wall next to where my bed is located and both tires are flat.  The smell of radiation lingers in the air. Lets not forget the erie text messages i found on my phone along with a random voicemail. What happened?  was this a kiss from God or something more sinister? 

    Siri, "What are energy weapons?"

    I am going back to sleep.  

    To be continued. . .
